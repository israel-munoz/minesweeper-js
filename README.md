Minesweeper game in JavaScript

The game is made completely in a canvas element.

Demo: http://cap-hermosillo.com/tests/minesweeper/

Requires support for canvas 2D.

JavaScript components:

- `canvas.js`: Extension for `<canvas>` to simplify drawing functions
- `records.js`: Script to get and set records. It uses `IndexedDB` for storage, and `Local Storage` as fallback
